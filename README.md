# A Blog Starter App

This is a trivial blog app, started with create-react-app.

It works entirely within memory, so reloads blow everything away except for the first two mock articles.

- To use this Blog App, users must first signi in. 
- Then they are able to add articles onto the blog by clicking on the "New Articles" button, and then type in a title and a body. 
- Blog App is like a journal, you can share and post whatever you would like onto it. 
- Because Blog App uses firebase, already meade articles are also included.
