# My Blog...

This is a trivial blog app, started with create-react-app.

It works with firebase, so data can be added using firebase.

- To use this Blog App, users must first sign in. 


- Then they are able to add articles onto the blog by clicking on the "New Articles" button, and then type in a title and a body. 


- The "My Blog" web app is like a journal, you can share and post whatever you would like onto it. 


- Atricles can be added from the web app itself, or from firebase.
